# KeeneticOS runs this with "hook" for every layer change of every NDM
# interface: $id (OpenVPN0, Wireguard1, Bridge0, ...), $system_name (its
# Linux name), $layer (conf|link|ctrl|ipv4|ipv6), $level (running|pending|
# disabled). Only the IPv4 layer of a VPN client interface matters: up, its
# tunnel table route can be installed; down, apply logs the WARN and marked
# traffic falls through to main until the next change. Detached for the
# reason netfilter.d gives.
#
# Not ifstatechanged.d: on 5.1.5 both directories fire, but one OpenVPN0
# down/up cycle gives this one exactly one "layer=ipv4 level=disabled" and
# one "layer=ipv4 level=running", while ifstatechanged.d's change=connected
# came only on the way up - the down edge would be missed.

# $id and $layer are NDM's, out of the hook environment; nothing here assigns them.
# shellcheck disable=SC2154
